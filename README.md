# Duels+ CLI
A lightweight CLI launcher for running the Duels+ proxy. Alternative to the [GUI launcher](https://duelsplus.com/download).

## Installation
You can install the CLI in two ways:

### Installer (Linux/macOS only)
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.duelsplus.com | bash
```

This script downloads the latest release for your target and installs the `duelsplus` binary.

### Manually
Download the latest release for your target (os/arch) from the [releases](https://github.com/duelsplus/cli/releases) page.

## Usage
You can launch the proxy simply by running `duelsplus`. To learn more about the commands included, enter `help` in the interactive command prompt, or run `duelsplus --help`.

## Development

git clone https://github.com/duelsplus/cli.git
cd cli
bun install
```
